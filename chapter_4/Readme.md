> Can you make a temp directory?

Yes, I can make a temp directory. I would run `mkdir temp` and that would create the directory.

> Can you make a log directory in your class directory?

Yes. First I would run `cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/building_the_toolbelt_t2_2015/`
then I would run `mkdir log`.
