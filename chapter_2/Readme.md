> 1) What directory are you in?

I would run `pwd` and it would show me `/Users/rebecca/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`

> 2) Are you in the class directory?

I would run `pwd` and it would show me `/Users/rebecca/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`.
The class directory is building_the_toolbelt_t2_2015, so I am not in the class directory.

> How to find the path with your graphical file browser:

When I run `pwd` it shows me `/Users/rebecca/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`.
To find this in in my graphical file browser first I need to open Finder. Since I am in Users/rebecca, I need to click on rebecca on the left side of the screen.
Next it says workspace, so I open the folder "workspace". The next thing pwd showed me was davinci_coders_t2_2015, so I open that folder.
The last two parts of pwd were homework/learn_command_line_exercises, so I open the folder "homework" and then the folder "learn_command_line_exercises".
Now I have found the path with Finder.
