> Try cat with a few more files.

I went back to by chapter_12 directory and ran `cat ex12.txt`.
It returned everything I had written in that exercise, which were the lyrics to some different songs.

> Try cat ex12.txt ex13.txt and see what it does.

I ran `cat chapter_12/ex12.txt chapter_13/tmp/ex13.txt` 
and it returned the text from ex12.txt and the text from ex13.txt immediately following it.

> Can you show me the contents of database.yml?

From the chapter_13 directory I would run `cat database.yml`.
It returns "Random text" which is the text I have in that file.

> What is in your Gemfile?

I would run `cat Gemfile` and it returns the text from that file, which is "More random text".
