"Morning Song" by The Avett Brothers
Hurt so bad
You don't come around here anymore
Worse than that
Nothing's really helping I've been thinking
'bout drinking again
It's alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there's hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
Her name became
The flame unto the fire
A magpie on the wire warned of those
Dead until the high
Shamelessly alive until the low.
It's alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don't go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there's hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
But we can go ahead
If no one notices
What's the point of it?
I have to ask
How you learn to see
Hope inside of me
When you're sure to be
On leave at last

"Anthem" by Titan
What would you say if I said let's leave this town behind
What would you say would it be I've lost my mind
What would you say if I said come with me
what would you say would it be, I'm crazy
I can't stand it here anymore
this ghost town has become, such a bore
baby jump in my car we'll race against the dawn
we'll keep on driving until we see that California sun
Why does it matter where we're going or where we've been
Just as long as we never see this town again
I can't stand it here anymore
This ghost town has become such a bore
Roll your window down let the wind caress your hair
we'll hit up every bar from here, to nowhere
got a whole in my pocket I'm dying to buy some fun
I can't find it in this town so, we'll find it on the run
What would you say if I said lets get out of this town
Would you say, let's burn this mother down
What would you say if I said I want you right beside me
would you call shotgun and pack your stuff up gladly
Because I can't stand it here anymore
This ghost town has become such a bore

"Never Been Alive" by The Avett Brothers
Woah, money won't do the trick
But it will help
Woah, to open the doors we need it to
To help someone else.
Still we won't need it
To turn things around.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive like I am now.
Woah, you need only tell me
When you're under the gun.
Woah, if you need someone to lend a hand
Consider it done.
Still you won't need me
To turn things around.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive, Woah.
I've never been alive like I am now.
Like I am now.
Like I am now.
Like I am now.

"Below my feet" by Mumford and Sons
You were cold as the blood through your bones
And the light which led us from our chosen homes
Well I was lost
And now I sleep
Sleep the hours and that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
I was lost
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
And I was still
I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus all was well
So all must be well
Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
So wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Oh keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Oh keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
